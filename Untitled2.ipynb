I love the job so much that I had to refuse already couple of jobs offer. Some of them was even better paid. But I just love what I’m doing and really enjoy it and I’m really very grateful for it tho. One think what I’m sad to say about the Borgwarner, that is richest company for who I worked but at the same moment most unorganised company. I worked in Germany, in France, in Switzerland and in uk. But the organisation is really bad at Borgwarner. For example sometimes we wait days for parts wich Borgwarner produce by themselves. And if our department call them and ask about how long we waiting or how long it will take until we get it. They sometimes even don’t give the team leader the answer and end the call. Or our management say to us to follow process and be strict with it and then when something get broken they not fixing it they just make it run again and we do mistakes and get fired because of them. And I think that is the big issue in Borgwarner maintenance and technicals. ( not all of them but most of them). Another thing what I really don’t get is that Borgwarner just fire people not because of the bad work literally just because of misunderstandings between people and nobody really interested on what is happened someone just decide to let people go and thats it. Happens to me as well. So I could save my job in the last minute. But it’s just doesn’t feel that my job is securit enough. But yeah in the front md of the day I would say Borgwarner is great place to work. ( definitely one of th best where I worked) and I’m very grateful for it. And of cause I can’t leave out our best manager Mas and Gil wich does amazing job. And of course our team leader Simon who does good job too .'\n",

            " \"Lack of contracts, differences between permanent and temporary staff strictly do not promote equality, also every meeting we attend we are constantly reminded of the bonus scheme which from my knowledge temps do not get, or don't get the entire bonus, therfore how do you expect people to work to their best quality, work safely and strive for the best, when temps are considered as being replaceable, when they make up the majority of the workforce, take STT line in PC on mid shift there's 7/8 people on the line daily,and only 1 member is permanent the rest are temps, this line is obviously a big money maker yet the staff aren't rewarded with him security, full bonuses, sick pay, holidays when they need them, you have to accrue holidays before they can be used and if you are sick you are forced to take a ssp. Muscular skeletal issues have been mentioned as a hotspot around the company, yet people have to lift full turbos on a daily basis, and the company questions MSK issues, it's right infront of you, bare minimum breaks, the only job rotation you have is within the line you are working at, day in day out, more training and swapping lines around would promote less msk issues as different movements would be used. A toolbox talk was presented a few weeks ago about the company having an interest in people health and wellbeing, expressing that a work life balances is necessary, quick is quickly contradicted by allowing people to do 12days working in a row, with no rest days is that really a work life balance? Bank Holiday Mondays can be taken with double pay onto if you take the days holiday also, so again less days off how is work life balance encouraged?\"\n",
